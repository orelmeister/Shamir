##  Autonomous System Features

### Layer 1: Observability Infrastructure
**Files**: observability.py

**SQLite Database** (trading_history.db):
- trades: Every buy/sell with P&L, metadata (RSI, VWAP, ATR)
- daily_metrics: Win rate, total P&L, drawdown, Sharpe ratio
- agent_health: CPU, memory, IBKR connection status
- parameter_changes: Optimization history with reasons
- evaluations: LLM insights and recommendations

**OpenTelemetry Tracing**:
- Distributed tracing for all trading operations
- Trade execution spans with timing
- Database operations traced
- Full observability stack

**Performance**: WAL mode + 4 indexes for 3-10x faster operations

### Layer 2: Self-Evaluation & Insights
**Files**: self_evaluation.py

**Performance Analyzer**:
- 15+ metrics: Win rate, P&L, drawdown, Sharpe ratio, risk/reward
- Average trade duration analysis
- Position size optimization
- Capital efficiency tracking

**AI Insights** (Optional):
- DeepSeek LLM integration for daily analysis
- Actionable recommendations
- Pattern recognition
- Graceful degradation if API key not set

**Health Monitor**:
- CPU and memory monitoring
- IBKR connection checks
- Auto-recovery attempts
- Health checks every 60 seconds

### Layer 3: Self-Healing
**Files**: day_trading_agents.py (integrated)

**Position Sync**:
- Queries IBKR on startup for all positions
- Syncs positions matching watchlist
- Prevents " forgotten position\ bugs
- Warns about positions not in watchlist

**Auto-Recovery**:
- Detects IBKR disconnections
- Automatic reconnection attempts
- Health status: normal, warning, critical
- Healing actions based on status

### Layer 4: Continuous Improvement
**Files**: continuous_improvement.py

**Market Regime Detection**:
- 5 regimes: trending up/down, high/low volatility, ranging
- Automatic detection from price data
- Regime-based parameter adjustments

**Adaptive Thresholds**:
- Dynamic profit target (0.8-3.0%)
- Dynamic stop loss (0.5-2.0%)
- Adaptive position sizing (3-10%)
- Safety bounds prevent extreme values

**A/B Testing Framework**:
- Test strategy variations
- Alternate strategies by day
- Track performance by variant
- Statistical comparison

**Daily Improvement Cycle**:
1. Analyze day''s performance
2. Generate LLM insights (if available)
3. Get parameter suggestions
4. Apply high-priority changes automatically
5. Detect market regime for next day
6. Generate JSON report

## Performance Optimizations

### System Requirements
- **CPU**: 4+ cores (optimized for 8 threads)
- **RAM**: 16+ GB (tested with 32GB)
- **Disk**: SSD recommended for database performance
- **Network**: Stable connection for IBKR API

### Optimization Features
**Parallel Processing**:
- 6 parallel workers (system threads - 2 for OS)
- ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent operations
- 5x faster watchlist analysis

**Database Performance**:

## How to Run

### Weekly Portfolio Bot

**Standard Run** (local LLM when market closed):
`
python main.py
`

**Force Online LLMs**:
`
python main.py --force-online
`

**Scheduled Mode** (run only on specific days):
`
python main.py --run-days Monday Thursday
python main.py --run-days Wednesday --interval 30
`

### Day Trading Bot

**Standard Run** (25% capital allocation):
`
python day_trader.py --allocation 0.25
`

**Custom Allocation**:
`
python day_trader.py --allocation 0.5 # 50% allocation
`

**What Happens**:
1. Connects to IBKR (port 4001, client ID 2)
2. Syncs existing positions from IBKR
3. Loads watchlist from day_trading_watchlist.json
4. Calculates capital per stock
5. Monitors every 5 seconds for entry/exit signals
6. Health checks every 60 seconds
7. At 3:55 PM: Liquidates all positions
8. After close: Runs improvement cycle, generates report

## Trading Strategy (Day Trader)

### Entry Criteria

2. **RSI < 60** (14-period)
3. **ATR > 1.5%** (minimum volatility)
4. **Sufficient capital** available

### Exit Criteria
1. **Profit Target**: +1.4% from entry
2. **Stop Loss**: -0.8% from entry
3. **EOD**: 3:55 PM automatic liquidation

### Position Sizing
- Equal allocation across watchlist
